# Enquiry Reminders

A very simple spreadsheet that will remind you (via email) to contact people on a date of your choosing. 

Comes with a few basic scripts to set it all up quickly and messily if you want, but is probably best edited before setup. 

## Requirements

- AutoHotkey
- Some understanding of Excel Macros / VBA

## Setup Instructions

`git clone https://github.com/julianorchard/chaseups`
`cd chaseups`
`setup.bat`

Then follow the instructions that come with that.
